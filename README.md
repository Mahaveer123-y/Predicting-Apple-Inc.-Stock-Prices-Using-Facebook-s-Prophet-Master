# -Predicting-Apple-Inc.-Stock-Prices-Using-Facebook-s-Prophet

We will try to predict Apple Inc. stock prices Using Facebookâ€™s Prophet. 
The daily stock prices for Apple Inc. can be downloaded from Yahoo Finance.  
Yahoo Finance is one of the leading sources of stock market data. 
We will get the data on Apple Inc. stock prices since 2015.

predicting Apple Inc. stock prices using Facebook's Prophet. The code involves data preparation, model training, and visualization of the predictions. 
Here's a breakdown and some suggestions:

## Data Preparation:
You've imported necessary libraries, including numpy, pandas, and matplotlib. pyplot, and installed fbprophet using conda.
The stock price data for Apple Inc. is read from a CSV file obtained from Yahoo Finance.
The dataset is initially displayed using data. head() and then modified to only include the 'Date' and 'Close' columns, which are then renamed to 'ds' and 'y', respectively.

## Model Training:
The training set (train) is created by selecting the first 1000 rows of the modified dataset, and a test set (test) is created for future comparison.
An object m of the Prophet class is created with daily seasonality enabled, and the model is fitted using the training data.

## Predictions and Visualization:
The make_future_dataframe method is used to create a data frame for future dates, and predictions are made using the predict method.
The predicted values are visualized using the plot method and the components of the forecast are shown using plot_components.
Additional visualizations are created using Plotly.

## Suggestions:
Test Set Creation: There's a typo in the test set creation. The line test = data. iloc[1000:0:2] 
seems to be incorrect. It might be intended to select rows from index 1000 onwards. It should be corrected to test = data.iloc[1000:, 0:2].

## Evaluation: 
After making predictions on the test set, consider evaluating the performance of the model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Interactive Plotly Chart: 
The Plotly chart is a great addition to interactive visualization. Ensure it provides insightful information for analysis.

## Hyperparameter Tuning: 
Depending on the model's performance, you may want to explore different hyperparameter settings for Prophet to improve prediction accuracy.

## Comments: 
Add comments in your code to explain the purpose of specific sections, especially if the code is intended for collaboration or future reference.
